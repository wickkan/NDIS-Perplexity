## Getting Started

First, make sure your terminal is in this directory:

```bash
# Check your current directory
pwd
```

It should end in `Decode-NDIS-Perplexity/frontend`.

Next, make sure your dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm i
# or
pnpm i
```

Configure your environment variables by copying `.env.example` into your `.env`. Make sure this file is not tracked by `git`.

Now, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
